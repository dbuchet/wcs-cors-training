If we look at the **Network Tab** in our Developer console, we can see that, for previous calls, we have in fact 2 requests sent at each \`fetch\`
\`\`\`shell
http://localhost:4000/step-2-1     OPTIONS     200
http://localhost:4000/step-2-1     GET         ERR_FAILED
\`\`\`

\`\`\`alert-info
# Pay attention!
\`GET\` request is a JS error, it's not an HTTP error code, which means this error code does not comes from a 4xx or 5xx API status code
\`\`\`

So what are these 2 calls, and what is this \`OPTIONS\` before my \`GET\`?

\`OPTIONS\` is a **Security check** triggered by your browser, to ensure that you are indeed allowed to request this resource. And this is called \`preflight\`.

![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/quest_editor_uploads/BwusUPP9rbKcHbQkbSK67LS03WUuBuiJ.png)

How \`OPTIONS\` works? Like other method, so let's see what headers are returned from this call:

\`\`\`
Allow: GET,HEAD,PUT
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 12
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
\`\`\`

So, from this \`preflight\` security check, there is no sign of \`Access-Control-Allow-Origin\`, so your origin doesn't seems to be authorized to perform this request, the \`preflight\` failed, so you \`fetch\` failed.

#### How to fix this?

Once again, it'll be on **back-end** side. \`OPTIONS\` is a verb for REST API, so we need to define a \`route\` for this \`OPTIONS\`, which will set the \`Access-Control-Allow-Origin\` and so our \`fetch\` won't be blocked

We do have our \`Access-Control-Allow-Origin\` so problem does not comes from here. Well, we just have to read at JS Error \`Request header field content-type is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers\` `} />
